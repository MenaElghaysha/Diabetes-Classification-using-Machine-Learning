# Diabetes Classification Project

This project focuses on building and evaluating a machine learning model for diabetes classification using the dataset provided in the `Diabetes_Classification.ipynb` notebook.

## 📌 Project Overview

The goal of this project is to:

* Explore and preprocess a medical dataset related to diabetes.
* Build a classification model to predict whether a patient has diabetes.
* Evaluate the model using various performance metrics.

## 📂 Repository Contents

* **Diabetes_Classification.ipynb**: The main Jupyter Notebook containing data analysis, visualizations, model training, and evaluation.
* **README.md**: Project documentation (this file).

## 🧪 Machine Learning Workflow

The notebook covers the following steps:

1. **Data Loading & Cleaning**
2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**
3. **Model Selection**
4. **Training & Testing**
5. **Model Evaluation** using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and confusion matrix.

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

* Python
* Jupyter Notebook
* Pandas
* NumPy
* Scikit-learn
* Matplotlib / Seaborn

## ▶️ How to Run the Project

1. Install required libraries:

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
2. Open the notebook:

   ```bash
   jupyter notebook Diabetes_Classification.ipynb
   ```

## 📊 Results

The notebook includes:

* Visualizations of the dataset
* Performance comparison of models
* Final chosen model based on best evaluation metrics

## 📈 Future Improvements

* Hyperparameter tuning (GridSearchCV / RandomizedSearchCV)
* Use more advanced algorithms (XGBoost, Random Forest, etc.)
* Deploy the model using Flask or FastAPI
